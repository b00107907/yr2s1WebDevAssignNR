      <p><strong>Providing training</strong> for employees is of course an essential factor in the success of any organisation. Current CAD &amp; BIM design software is very complex and takes time to master. In the hands of trained employees it can deliver high quality output and cut the time and cost of rework significantly.</p>
      <p>All too often we see situations where employess are left to find their own way resulting in the acquisition of bad habits and poor methodologies which can severely compromise the resulting models and require expensive remediation.</p>
      <p>Keeping well-trained employees pays dividends for organisations because the cost of employee turnover in the construction and engineering sectors can be high and studies carried out by Engineers Ireland have shown that organisations which provide adequate training have better employee retention than those which take a casual approach. The three primay benefits identified were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Time and cost savings</li>
        <li>Lower staff turnover</li>
        <li>Improved quality of project deliverables</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Our Autodesk certified training</strong> is always tailored specifically to the requirements of the organisation and is delivered in your own offices. The maximum group size is capped at 8 persons to ensure the trainer can spend ample time with individual employees.</p>
