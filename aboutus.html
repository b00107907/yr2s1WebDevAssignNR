    <article class="wideblock">
      <p><strong>Founded by Martina McGuire in 1999, </strong>Marlan Systems has been providing CAD and Design services to clients across Ireland for almost two decades.</p>
      <p>Initially focussed in the Civil Engineering sector demand grew and Martina added Electrical and Mechanical design and draughting services to the portfolio.</p>
      <p>More complex projects followed and by 2014 the need to contract in additional skill sets became apparent which led to the creation of a team of independent engineers and designers working collaboratively via the Internet.</p>
      <p>Our approach has since evolved further to focus on training and consultancy with the emphasis today on providing high level consultancy expertise to our client's own project teams to help them improve workflows and thus meet project deliverables with maximum efficiency.</p>
      <p>Training is particularly beneficial when new staff are taken on and helps quantify end user proficiency against industry established benchmarks.</p>
      <p><strong>The team </strong>consists of half a dozen independent experts, all of whom are certified construction and engineering professionals covering a diverse range of disciplines including Architectural, Civil, Mechanical and Electrical. In addition, we have infrastructure and ICT expertise on tap to provide a full range of services.</p>
      <p>We also work with a range of partners to integrate additional disciplines as required including Quantity Surveyors, Production Engineers, Environmental experts and other specialist expertise on an as required basis.</p>
