      <p>Despite the terms being used interchangeably Revit and BIM are not the same thing. This commonly held misunderstanding leads to problems with compliance because BIM is a process whereas Revit is a product. BIM standards encompass a range of design and visualisation softwares from multiple vendors while Revit is an individual AutoDesk product.</p>
      <p>Our experts can teach you industry-proven techniques to take full advantage of BIM methodology so you can create your best designs faster, more cost-effective and more efficient than ever.</p>

    <article class="wideblock">
      <p>As stated above, <em><strong>BIM is a process not an application.</strong></em> It is based around models used for the planning, design, construction and management of building and infrastructure projects and aims to deliver these projects faster, more economically and with less environmental impact.</p>
      
		<img class="img-fr" src="images/bim-model.jpg" width="275" height="164" alt="BIM Model"/>
		<p>These BIM models are different from CAD drawings which may be 2D or 3D in nature. A BIM model is essentially a database of "intelligent objects" that have qualitative data assigned to them and are intended to be used in a collaborative manner by diverse disciplines across the project team.</p>
      <p>Planners, Architects, Engineers and Construction professionals all use the same core model as a framework on which to build and integrate their designs in a collaborative manner to deliver the completed project.</p>
      <p>For this reason, understanding of, and compliance to, BIM standards is essential to avoid expensive rework at a later stage. One of our core services is BIM consultancy which aims to assist organisations and individual professionals in this process.</p>
